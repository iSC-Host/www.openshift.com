This Agreement is effective (&quot;<strong>Effective Date</strong>&quot;) on the earlier of the date that You accept this Agreement or the date that You first use Red Hat  Software or Services (defined below).  This Agreement establishes a framework that will enable You to receive certain services from Red Hat (the &quot;<strong>Services</strong>&quot;), which may include access to software and related materials (the &quot;<strong>Software</strong>&quot;) and may require the payment of Fees (defined below).  Appendix A sets forth additional terms applicable to specific Services and Software.   As further described below, You agree to comply with the Red Hat Acceptable Use Policy, which is incorporated into this Agreement, the most recent version of which can be reviewed at <a href="../legal.html">https://www.openshift.com/legal</a> (the &quot;<strong>Acceptable Use Policy</strong>&quot;).  Please read <strong>Appendix A</strong> and the <strong>Red Hat Acceptable Use Policy</strong> which describe terms that govern Your use of Services.   </p>
<p><strong>2.    General Conditions of Use</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   </p>
<p><strong>2.1   Your Account.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  In order to access the Services, You will be required to create an account (&quot;<strong>Your Account</strong>&quot;). You may create only one account per email address and You must verify that the email address You have provided is valid and will remain valid during the term of this Agreement.  Your user name must be consistent with the Acceptable Use Policy and must not impersonate someone else or cause confusion as to source, affiliation or endorsement.  You may not (or permit third parties to) create multiple accounts that act or appear as a single account or otherwise access the Services in a manner that is intended to avoid Fees or to circumvent maximum capacity thresholds for the Services.  You must maintain the confidentiality of Your password and Your Account information and are solely responsible for all activities and/or actions that occur with respect to Your Account whether by You or a third party user (&quot;<strong>Your User</strong>&quot;). </p>
<p><strong>2.2   Your Use.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  You agree to use the Services in accordance with, and comply with, all applicable laws and regulations and this Agreement, including but not limited to the Acceptable Use Policy.  You further agree that You will not induce or solicit Your Users or other third parties to commit unlawful acts in connection with the Services or to obtain unauthorized access to the Services.  In addition, You agree not to interfere with Red Hat&#39;s ability to provide any of the Services to any other user or with another user&#39;s ability to receive the Services.  You are solely responsible for determining the suitability of the Services for Your use in light of any applicable laws and/or regulations such as data protection and privacy laws and regulations.  Red Hat makes no representations or warranties regarding the suitability of the Services for use by You, or the Services&#39; compliance with the requirements of any applicable laws, regulations or industry standards.</p>
<p><strong>2.3   Third Party Use.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  If You provide Your Users with access to Content (defined below) and/or the Services, You are responsible for any third party that You enable or authorize to have access to the Services and You will be deemed to have taken any action that You permit, facilitate or assist Your Users in taking relating to this Agreement, Content or use of the Services.

If Red Hat has reason to believe that You or Your Users have breached this Agreement or the Acceptable Use Policy, Red Hat or its designated agent may inspect Your use of the Services, including Your Account, Content  and records, to verify Your compliance with this Agreement.  You will not interfere with our monitoring and will provide Content or other information regarding Your Account as may be reasonably requested by Red Hat to ensure Your use complies with this Agreement.  Red Hat reserves the right (but has no obligation) to suspend or terminate Your access to the Services or disable Your or Your Users&#39; Content if Red Hat, in its sole discretion, believes You have breached  the terms of the Agreement, any policy to which we refer in this Agreement or have violated any applicable law.

<p><strong>2.5   Third Party Services.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  There may be third party software and/or services made available to You by Red Hat or third parties on or in connection with the OpenShift Online platform, any Red Hat marketplace or otherwise in connection with Your use of the Services (&quot;<strong>Third Party Service(s)</strong>&quot;).  Red Hat provides no warranty, does not necessarily support and has not necessarily confirmed the validity, functionality or screened the content of such Third Party Services and any use is at Your own risk.  Availability of such Third Party Services does not constitute an endorsement by Red Hat and availability of the Third Party Services does not necessarily mean that the Third Party Services will interoperate with any Red Hat Services, regardless of whether the Third Party Services are described as Red Hat &quot;certified&quot;.  The terms that apply to any Content you provide to the Third Party Service are solely between you and the Third Party Service and Your use of the Third Party Services is subject to the Third Party Service&#39;s policies.

<p><strong>4.2   Privacy Policy.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Any data or Content that You provide in connection with the use of the Services will be subject to and may be used in accordance with the Red Hat Privacy Statement set forth at <a href="openshift_privacy.html">https://www.openshift.com/legal/openshift_privacy</a> (the &quot;<strong>Privacy Statement</strong>&quot;).  If You provide Your Users with access to an application You create in connection with the Services, You agree to protect the privacy of Your Users&#39; data, including implementing an appropriate privacy policy (that at a minimum contains terms substantially similar to those of the Privacy Statement) and notifying Your Users that their data will be stored on facilities accessible to Red Hat.  </p>
<p><strong>4.3   Data Security.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  You agree to use reasonable security precautions in light of Your use of the Services, including encrypting Personally Identifiable Information transmitted to and from, and while stored on, the Services.  In addition, You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for taking steps to maintain appropriate security, protection and backup of Content.  Red Hat makes no representation regarding the security of the Services or Your Content.  In the event of unauthorized access to Content, You are responsible for complying with any applicable laws and regulations, including, for example, those that require notification of individuals whose Personally Identifiable Information may have been compromised.  &quot;<strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong>&quot; means: (i) a combination of any information that identifies an individual with that individual's sensitive and non-public financial, health or other data or attribute, such as a combination of the individual's name, address, or phone number with the individual's social security number or other government issued number, financial account number, date of birth, address, biometric data, mother's maiden name, or other personally identifiable information; (ii) any &quot;non-public personal information&quot; as that term is defined in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act found at 15 USC Subchapter 1, &#167; 6809(4), and (iii) &quot;protected health information&quot; as defined in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (&quot;HIPAA&quot;) found at 45 CFR &#167;160.103.  Red Hat is not acting as a &quot;Business Associate&quot; as that term is defined in HIPAA.</p>
<p><strong>4.4   Legal Process.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Red Hat may provide information, including Content and information concerning Your Account, as required by law (such as responding to a subpoena, warrant, audit, or agency action, or to prevent fraud) or to establish or exercise its legal rights or to defend against legal claims.  Red Hat shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information to such third parties.</p>
<p><strong>5.    Changes and Updates to Terms.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Red Hat may modify this Agreement (including Appendix A and the Acceptable Use Policy) at any time by posting a revised version at <a href="../legal.html">https://www.openshift.com/legal</a>, by otherwise notifying You in accordance with Section 18 below, and/or by requiring You to accept the new revised terms.  The modified terms will become effective (i) upon posting, (ii) if we notify You by email, as stated in the email message, or (iii) otherwise upon Your acceptance.

Red Hat reserves the right at any time to change and/or discontinue any or all of the Services (including the underlying platforms and application programming interfaces (&quot;<strong>APIs</strong>&quot;) and/or application binary interfaces (&quot;<strong>ABIs</strong>&quot;) which may inhibit Your ability to use existing applications. Red Hat will use reasonable efforts to provide notice of material changes to the Services on the applicable Services website.  </p>
<p><strong>6.2   Service Levels.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Services are generally provided through internet connectivity and third party vendors that Red Hat does not control and may be subject to delays, outages or other problems; Red Hat is not responsible for any such delays or outages.  More broadly, Red Hat makes no service level-related representations, warranties, or covenants regarding Service uptime, connectivity, hosting conditions, load balancing, security, monitoring, backup, archiving, recovery, release management, change control, maintenance, availability, and the like, and will offer no Services credits for service levels You deem inadequate.</p>
<p><strong>7.    Fees and Payment</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.1   Fees.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  No fees are due for any Free Services (defined in Appendix A).  Services are subject to usage limitations after which Fees, or additional Fees, may apply.  Fees for the Paid Services (defined in Appendix A) (the &quot;<strong>Fees</strong>&quot;) are due upon Red Hat&#39;s acceptance of an order and, for renewal of the Services, at the start of the renewal term, and payable in accordance with Section 7.2. You agree to pay Red Hat any applicable subscription service Fees to receive the Paid Service (&quot;<strong>Subscription Service Fees</strong>&quot;) and  Fees per &quot;<strong>Unit</strong>&quot; (defined in Appendix A) (&quot;Unit Fees&quot;) for all usage by You or Your Users (as described in Appendix A) during the calendar month period.  The Subscription Service Fees are charged upfront on a calendar month or annual basis at the beginning of the term in which Services are to be provided. The Unit Fees, if any, are charged in arrears at the beginning of the month based on usage in the prior month. The Paid Services will automatically renew until terminated as specified in this Agreement.  Any renewal of the Subscription Service Fees will be at the same price for the applicable term. Red Hat reserves the right to modify any Fees for any subsequent term by providing You with thirty (30) days prior notice.  All Fees are nonrefundable.   You may be charged interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) on all late payments.  </p>
<p><strong>7.2.1 Credit Card Processing.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  For any Paid Services purchased through the OpenShift Online portal, You must first provide Red Hat with a valid and authorized credit card number and associated charge information prior to receiving Services and You (a) authorize Red Hat to charge Your credit card for any Fees, including for both the Subscription Service and Unit Fees, and for the amount due at the time of renewal of the Services, and (b) if needed, agree to provide updated credit card information to Red Hat for subsequent Fees due.  In order to provide the Services, Red Hat may be required to share Your information, including credit card and other financial information, with third parties solely for the purpose of processing payment and/or providing the Services.</p>
<p><strong>7.2.2 Order Form.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If You are purchasing the Paid Services from Red Hat other than through the OpenShift Online portal, the following terms will apply.  Fees will be identified in an ordering document (&quot;<strong>Order Form</strong>&quot;) and are (a) due upon Red Hat&#39;s acceptance of an Order Form or, for renewal of Services, at the start of the renewal term, and (b) payable in accordance with this section. If credit terms are provided to You, Red Hat will invoice You for the Fees upon Red Hat&#39;s acceptance of the applicable Order Form and upon acceptance of any future order. Unless otherwise specified in an Order Form and subject to Red Hat&#39;s approval of credit terms, You will pay Fees, no later than thirty (30) days from the date of each invoice.  Red Hat reserves the right to suspend or cancel performance of all or part of the Services and/or change its credit terms if actual payment has not been received within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.</p>
<p><strong>7.3   Taxes.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  All Fees are exclusive of Taxes. You will pay Red Hat an amount equal to any Taxes arising from or relating to this Agreement which are paid by or are payable by Red Hat. &quot;<strong>Taxes</strong>&quot; means any form of sales, use, value added or other form of taxation and any fines, penalties, surcharges or interest, but excluding any taxes based solely on the net income of Red Hat. If You are required to withhold or deduct any portion of the payments due to Red Hat, You will increase the sum payable to Red Hat by the amount necessary so that Red Hat receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had You made no withholdings or deductions.</p>
<p><strong>7.4   Future Availability.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  You acknowledge that Your purchase of the Services is not contingent on the future availability of any new features or functionality.</p>
<p><strong>7.5   Promotions.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  From time to time, Red Hat may offer you certain promotional pricing or programs during a specific term (&quot;<strong>Promotional Period</strong>&quot;).  Your use of the Services during any such Promotional Period will be limited to the term of the Promotional Period and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as well as any additional terms that Red Hat may provide in connection with the Promotional Period.  </p>

<p>FOR ALL EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, RED HAT, ITS AFFILIATES&#39; AND  THEIR LICENSORS&#39; AND VENDORS&#39; AGGREGATE AND CUMULATIVE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ON ACCOUNT OF PERFORMANCE OR NON-PERFORMANCE OF OBLIGATIONS, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE OR OTHERWISE WILL BE LIMITED TO DIRECT DAMAGES AND WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS RECEIVED BY RED HAT DURING TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE FIRST EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY, WITH RESPECT TO THE PARTICULAR ITEMS (WHETHER SOFTWARE, SERVICES OR OTHERWISE) GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY. </p>
<p>LIABILITY FOR THESE DAMAGES DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION 11 WILL BE LIMITED OR EXCLUDED (AS THE CASE MAY BE) EVEN IF ANY EXCLUSIVE REMEDY PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT FAILS ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.  TO THE EXTENT THAT LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN DAMAGES MAY NOT BE LAWFULLY EXCLUDED OR LIMITED AS PROVIDED ABOVE, THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION 11 WILL BE ENFORCED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  </p>
<p><strong>12.   No Warranties.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <strong>You understand and agree that the Software and Services may contain bugs, errors and/or inadequacies.</strong>  FOR ALL CIRCUMSTANCES AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE OF RED HAT, ITS AFFILIATES AND THEIR LICENSORS AND VENDORS AND ANY THIRD PARTY SERVICES  ARE PROVIDED  &quot;AS IS&quot;, &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; AND WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

<p><strong>13.   Indemnification.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Red Hat, its affiliates and their licensors and vendors, and each of their respective employees, officers, directors, and representatives from and against any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and associated litigation expenses) arising out of or relating to: (a) Your use and/or Your Users&#39; use of the Services and Software; (b) Your breach of this Agreement or the Acceptable Use Policy, or violation of applicable law by You and/or Your Users; (c) Content or the combination of Content with other applications, content or processes, (d) any claim or allegation that Content infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of any third party; (e) Red Hat&#39;s response to any third party subpoena, warrant, audit, agency action or other legal order or process concerning Content, Your Account and/or use by You and/or Your Users of the Services and Software or (f) any dispute between You and a Third Party Service or You and Your User.  Red Hat will provide You with written notice of any claim, suit or action, but its failure to do so does not relieve Your of Your obligations under this section.</p>
<p><strong>14.   Export Control.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Red Hat may supply You with software, services and/or technical data that are subject to export control restrictions under the laws of the United States or other countries (the &quot;<strong>Export Control Laws</strong>&quot;).  You agree to comply with all applicable Export Control Laws in connection with Your use of the Services, Your Content and Your Users and agree not to use the Services or Software if You or Your Users are barred from receiving them under any of the Export Control Laws (for example, if You or they are located in a jurisdiction that is subject to United States sanctions regulations, which currently includes Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria and which are subject to change as posted by the United States government).  Red Hat will not be responsible for Your compliance with the Export Control Laws.  If (a) You breach this section, the export control provisions of a Software license agreement or any provision referencing these sections or (b) it would be a violation of any of the Export Control Laws for Red Hat to provide You with access to any of the Services, Red Hat may terminate this Agreement immediately without liability to You.  You agree that You will not use the Services in connection with any nuclear, chemical or biological weapons or missile technology, unless authorized by the relevant government agency by regulation or specific license.</p>
<p><strong>15.   Confidentiality</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>15.1  Obligations.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both parties agree that (i) Confidential Information will be used only in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; (ii) each will use the same degree of care it utilizes to protect its own confidential information, but in no event less than reasonable care; and (iii) the Confidential Information may be disclosed only to employees, agents and contractors with a need to know, and to its auditors and legal counsel, in each case, who are under a written obligation to keep such information confidential using standards of confidentiality not less restrictive than those required by this Agreement. Both parties agree that obligations of confidentiality will exist for a period of two (2) years following initial disclosure of the particular Confidential Information. &quot;<strong>Confidential Information</strong>&quot; means all information disclosed by either Red Hat or You (&quot;<strong>Disclosing Party</strong>&quot;) to the other party (&quot;<strong>Recipient</strong>&quot;) during the term of this Agreement that is either (i) marked confidential or (ii) disclosed orally and described as confidential at the time of disclosure and subsequently set forth in writing, marked confidential, and sent to the Recipient within thirty (30) days following the oral disclosure. </p>
<p><strong>15.2  Exclusions.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Confidential Information will not include information which: (i) is or later becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement, or is disclosed by the Disclosing Party without obligation of confidentiality; (ii) is known to the Recipient at the time of disclosure by the Disclosing Party; (iii) is independently developed by the Recipient without use of the Confidential Information; (iv) becomes lawfully known or available to the Recipient without restriction from a source having the lawful right to disclose the information; (v) is generally known or easily ascertainable by parties of ordinary skill in the business of the Recipient; or (vi) is software code in either object code or source code form that is licensed under an open source license. The Recipient will not be prohibited from complying with disclosure mandated by applicable law if, where reasonably practicable and without breaching any legal or regulatory requirement, it gives the Disclosing Party advance notice of the disclosure requirement.</p>
<p><strong>16.   Term and Termination</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>16.1  Free Services.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  With respect to Your use of the Free Services, You may stop using the Services or may terminate Your Account at any time.  Red Hat may terminate or suspend Your use of the Free Services and/or this Agreement at any time.  Red Hat may, at its discretion terminate Your Account and remove Your Content if Your Account has been inactive for more than ninety (90) days.  </p>
<p><strong>16.2  Paid Services.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Paid Services shall continue to renew for additional terms for so long as You are current in Your payment of all applicable Fees and not in breach of this Agreement, unless you provide notice of non-renewal at least two (2) business days prior to the end of the then current term.  Regardless of when you provide notice to Red Hat of non-renewal or termination of the Subscription Services during the month, you will be entitled to receive the Services until the end of the month.  If You wish to downgrade from the Paid Services to the Free Services, You are responsible for: (1) selecting to downgrade on the OpenShift Online management console, (2) removing any Content in order to meet the capacity limits that apply to the Free Services and (3) following any additional steps to downgrade prior to the end of the month.  You will continue to incur Fees until you successfully downgrade to the Free Services, including completing the actions described above.  All Fees are non-refundable even if You terminate the Services prior to the end of the month. Red Hat may terminate the Agreement in its sole discretion on thirty (30) days prior notice; provided that if You have pre-paid for Services beyond such thirty (30) day period, Red Hat may provide You either, at its sole discretion, a pro rata refund of pre-paid Fees or the ability to continue to use the Services for such pre-paid period.  Either Party may terminate the Agreement for material breach by the other Party of this Agreement if the breach is not remedied within twenty (20) days of receiving notice of such breach.  Without limiting other rights that Red Hat may have, Red Hat may suspend or terminate Your Services, and Your Account or disable Your or Your User&#39;s Content immediately if Red Hat reasonably believes You have breached this Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy or applicable law.  </p>
<p><strong>16.3  Effect of Termination.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Upon termination of the Agreement, You will be required to pay any outstanding Fees that are due, all rights under this Agreement will cease and You may no longer use the Services or any Software.  Following termination of Your Account, You will no longer have access to the Services, or any Content stored in connection with the Services.  You are responsible for ensuring that You have additional copies of any Content.  The following sections of this Agreement will survive such termination or expiration: Sections 2.5, 3.4, 4.4, 8 and 11-21 and any post-termination requirements set forth in Appendix A.  </p>
<p><strong>17.   Governing Law/Consent to Jurisdiction.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The validity, interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and of the State of New York without giving effect to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof or the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. All disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction located in Raleigh, North Carolina, and each party irrevocably consents to such personal jurisdiction and waives all objections to this venue.  In the event the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) or any similar federal or state laws or regulations are enacted, it will not apply to this Agreement, and the governing law will remain as if such law or regulation had not been enacted.</p>
<p><strong>18.   Notices.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Red Hat may provide a notice to You under this Agreement by: (i) posting the notice on the Services website; or (ii) sending a message to the email address associated with Your Account.  Notices provided by posting on the Services website will be effective upon posting and notices provided by email will be effective when Red Hat sends the email.  It is Your responsibility to keep Your email address current and to update Your profile with Red Hat if it changes. You will be deemed to have received any email sent to the email address associated with Your Account following transmission by Red Hat, whether or not You actually receive the email.  To give notice to Red Hat under this Agreement, You must contact Red Hat either by (1) overnight courier to Red Hat, Inc., Attention: General Counsel, 100 East Davie Street, Raleigh, North Carolina 27601 or (2) facsimile at (919) 754-3704.

<p><strong>19.   Publicity and Benchmarking.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  You may not misrepresent Your relationship with Red Hat nor suggest or publish that Red Hat or any of its affiliates or licensors endorses, sponsors, contributes to or provides support for Content. You may not publish the results of any benchmarking studies that You conduct in connection with the Services or publish any press releases regarding Your use of the Services unless You obtain Red Hat&#39;s prior written approval. </p>
<p><strong>20.   Miscellaneous.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This Agreement is binding on the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Agreement grants any other person or entity any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever.  Nothing in this Agreement will be construed to create an employment or agency relationship between You and Red Hat (or any Red Hat personnel).  All headings contained in this Agreement are inserted for identification and convenience and will not be deemed part of this Agreement for purposes of interpretation. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable for any reason but would be valid and enforceable if appropriately modified, then such provision will apply with the modification necessary to make it valid and enforceable. If such provision cannot be so modified, the parties agree that such invalidity will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement. The delay or failure of either party to exercise any rights under this Agreement will not constitute or be deemed a waiver or forfeiture of such rights. No waiver will be valid unless in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the party against whom such waiver is sought to be enforced.  This Agreement, including any policy referenced herein, represents the final, complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between the parties with respect to its subject matter, notwithstanding any prior written agreements or prior and contemporaneous oral agreements with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.  Neither party may assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party; provided, however, that Red Hat may assign this Agreement without such consent to an affiliate or to any third party in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of its business or assets to which this Agreement relates.  Red Hat and its affiliates will not be liable for any delay or failure to provide Services where the delay or failure results from any cause beyond its reasonable control, including acts of God, labor disputes or other industrial disturbances, systemic electrical, telecommunications, or other utility failures, earthquake, storms or other elements of nature, blockages, embargoes, riots, acts or orders of government, acts of terrorism, or war.</p>
<p><strong>21.   Waiver of Jury Trial.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EACH PARTY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.</p>

<p><strong>2.  Domain Names.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  In order to utilize some of the Services, You may be required to create a unique domain name.
